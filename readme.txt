1. Upload the plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I need this plugin? =

You don't really need this plugin. Without the plugin you should be able to drag a new file to upload it even if the Media Library tab is open. This plugin just makes it easier for anyone who has not discovered that this is the case.

= Where is the admin page? =

It doesn't have any options, so there isn't one.

= It doesn't work. Whats up with that? =

The plugin does work on the sites it has been tested on. If it is not working for you, please ask for help on the plugin's support forum, but please don't embarass yourself by leaving a poor review before asking for help.

= I am using the plugin and love it, how can I show my appreciation? =

You can donate via [my donation page](https://cubecolour.co.uk/wp/ "cubecolour donation page"). If you find the plugin useful I would also appreciate a glowing five star review on the [plugin review page](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/upload-files-by-default-when-inserting-media "Upload Files by Default When Inserting Media review page")
